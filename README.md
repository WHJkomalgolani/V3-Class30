To do list:
C30 - 
1)Load the images of background and watermelon
3)Now let’s create the Sprite for the bunny.
For the bunny, we will not create a physics body, because
we only need it to play its animation and detect the
collision with fruit.
4)we need to create a function to drop the melon and
break the rope.
● Cut the rope from the top point where it is
connected.
● Cut the fruit from the rope
